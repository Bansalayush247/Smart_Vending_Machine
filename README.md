# Smart Vending Machine  

**A seamless and modern vending experience powered by NFC, NodeMCU, and Raspberry Pi**  

---

## **Overview**  

The **Smart Vending Machine** project modernizes traditional vending systems by enabling contactless interaction. Users can scan their NFC-enabled devices, browse items through a dynamic web interface, and complete purchases with ease. This innovative approach enhances hygiene, convenience, and operational efficiency.

## **Project Workflow**  

1. **Scan**: Users scan their NFC-enabled devices (phones) via the RFID scanner.  
2. **Identify**: NodeMCU processes the scanned data and forwards it to Raspberry Pi.  
3. **Browse**: Raspberry Pi hosts a web interface, enabling users to browse and select products.  
4. **Purchase**: Users complete transactions via the web application for a seamless, contactless experience.

## **Analysis and Findings**  

- **Initial Challenges**:  
  - MQTT was explored for communication but was incompatible with hardware, leading to the adoption of HTTP.  
  - Using Raspberry Pi on both ends was deemed redundant.  

- **Solutions**:  
  - NodeMCU proved to be the ideal intermediary between the RFID reader and Raspberry Pi.

## **Future Enhancements**  

1. **Adopt BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)** for short-range, energy-efficient data exchange.  
2. **Implement LoRaWAN** for low-power, long-range communication in remote deployments.  
3. **Revisit MQTT** using advanced microcontrollers like ESP32 for better message brokering.  
4. **Hybrid Protocols**: Combine HTTP, WebSockets, and BLE for versatile communication.  
5. **Edge Computing**: Enable localized decision-making to reduce server dependency.

## **How to Use**  

1. **Setup Hardware**:  
   - Connect the NodeMCU with an RFID scanner.  
   - Link the Raspberry Pi to host the backend and web application.  

2. **Run Backend Application**:  
   - Deploy the web interface on Raspberry Pi.  
   - Ensure NodeMCU and Raspberry Pi are networked.  

3. **Interact**:  
   - Users scan their NFC-enabled devices to browse and purchase items seamlessly.
